# Project on Linear and Logistic Regression
## Project Overview
This project includes both the linear regression on Ecommers Clinets and Logistic regression on Breast Cancer Diagnosis. According to the requirements only one of the two regression method was asked but due to the use of sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression in Linear Regression for simplicity due to execution problem, I dicided to try Logistic Regression without using the function.
## Dataset used for Linear Regression
Dataset [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website). The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website, including the following:
Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. Note that all the personal information is not real.
## Dataset used for Logistic Regression
Data [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). Here the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains some very detailed measurements of cells. Along with each observation of measurements, it contains diagnosis of the cell (malignant or not).
